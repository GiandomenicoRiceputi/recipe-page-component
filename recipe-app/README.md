# Recipe Page

Hi! This is my solution for the [Recipe page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/recipe-page-KiTsR8QQKm).
[Live Demo](https://lovely-zuccutto-f55b55.netlify.app/)

## Project Overview

I built this page to practice using React with TypeScript and CUBE CSS. The goal was to make a clean, accessible recipe page that looks great on all devices, handling responsive design with fluid typography/spacing (Utopia).

## My Process

I believe that for a project to be successful, the foundation needs to be solid. Here is how I tackled this one:

1. **Scaffolding**: I started by setting up the project structure and identifying the core components.
2. **HTML & CSS (First)**: My philosophy is that the product must be **UI/UX perfect** before touching any complex logic. I focused entirely on the semantic HTML structure and the CUBE CSS styling first. This ensures accessibility and a polished look right from the start.
3. **Logic (Last)**: Once the UI was perfect, I wired up the React components. Since the heavy lifting of layout and style was already done, identifying where to split components and how to pass data became much clearer.

## Tech Stack

- **React**: For building the UI components.
- **TypeScript**: For type safety and better developer experience.
- **Vite**: For fast development and building.
- **CUBE CSS**: My styling methodology (Composition, Utility, Block, Exception).

## How to Run It

1. Clone the repo.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the dev server: `npm run dev`
4. Open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser.

## Structure

- `src/components`: Individual UI components like `PreparationTime`, `IngredientsList`, etc.
- `src/css`: Global styles, reset, and composition layer.
- `src/assets`: Images and fonts.
